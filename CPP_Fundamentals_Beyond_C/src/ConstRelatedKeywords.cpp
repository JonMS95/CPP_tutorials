#include "ConstRelatedKeywords.hpp"

/*
The aim of this lesson is to learn about modern const related keywords:

路constexpr: similar to inline in C, it can lead the variable / function
    tagged as constexpr to be evaluated during compile-time as long as
    inputs are known. It may fall back to runtime otherwise. Variables
    are not modifiable afterwards.
路consteval: unlike constexpr, this forces compile-time evaluation. If
    the argument is unknown, it leads to compilation error.
路constinit: ensures a variable with static storage is initialized at
    compile time but allowing the variable in question to change later
    if needed.
路mutable:   makes object within const object modifiable (for example,
    a class member inside a given class instance).

// If x unavailable -> compilation error.

// Variable is forced to be initialized during compilation, but it's still modifiable afterwards.
constinit int globalCounter = 0;

// const as part of a class method declaration means that the method in question can't modify a
// class member (unless mutable). Can't be done with free functions.
