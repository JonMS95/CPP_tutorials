    // Smart pointers are a safer way to allocate and deallocate heap memory than using "new" and "delete" keywords, since
    // memory is freed automatically when it is no longer used. Essentially, smart pointers are just a kind of wrappers
    // around raw pointers, thus, new and delete are implicitly called when using smart pointers. In fact, the usage of the
    // "delete" keyword to deallocate memory that has been previously allocated by using these pointers is forbidden, as it
    // can lead to undefined behaviour or memory leaks as allocated memory could be freed twice.
    // As of 2023, there are 4 types of smart pointers:
    // 路Unique pointers:    also known as "scope pointers", they only exist within the scope in which they were previously
    //                      created. As the name suggests, just a single pointer to a specificied memory address may exist.
    // 路Shared pointers:    
    // 路Weak pointers:      
    // 路Auto pointers:      deprecated from C++11 onwards, replaced by unique pointers which provide improved safety.

    // In contrast to unique pointers, the lifetime of shared pointers is not constrained to the scope in which they were instantiated.
    // The way this works under the hood is by using a technique known as reference counting. Basically, it keeps track of how many
    // references exist to the pointer, so that the reserved memory is only freed once it is known that no reference to that memory
    // space exist. The syntax for this type of pointer is similar to the one used in unique pointers:
    // std::shared_ptr<class_name> pointer_name(new object());
    // std::shared_ptr<class_name> pointer_name = std::make_shared<class_name>();
    // Again, in this case it is way more efficient to use the latter syntax, since it needn't call the constructor first an then the
    // reference counter mechanism, but all at the same instead.

    // was been created, since a reference stored in pDummy2 still existed (the latter pointer exists outside the scope). Apart from that,
    // the pointer can be easily copied. In conclusion, the memory was freed only when the scope in which pDummy2 was created no longer
